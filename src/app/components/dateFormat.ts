/* ── One date format for every listing ───────────────────────────────────────
   The grids used to print dates four different ways — "Tue, 19/Apr/2022 03:30 AM" in the
   Created column, "Tue, 19/04/2022 03:30 AM" for optional date columns, "02 Mar 2026" for
   the newer ones, and raw "24/07/2026" strings straight out of the licence, contract and
   purchase mocks. Two of those are AMBIGUOUS: a reader cannot tell 24/07 from 07/24
   without knowing which locale wrote it, and an ITSM grid is read by people in several.

   The house format fixes that:

       19 Apr 2026, 03:30 AM     a moment  (created, last updated, last login…)
       19 Apr 2026               a day     (start/end, expiry, required by…)

   Why this shape:
   • A THREE-LETTER MONTH can never be misread as a day — the single most common cause of
     a misread date in a multi-region service desk.
   • Day-first matches how the rest of the product writes dates and how most of its users
     read them, while the month name makes the order irrelevant anyway.
   • NO WEEKDAY. "Tue," is noise in a dense grid — nobody triages by which day of the week
     a ticket was raised — and it cost ~40px of column on every date in the product.
   • A 12-HOUR clock with a measured AM/PM, because that is what the detail pages show.
   • Time only where a field IS a moment. A contract's end date has no meaningful 00:00,
     and printing one invites the reader to believe it.

   Anything written as a SENTENCE (an SLA tooltip's "Due by Thursday, October 1, 2026")
   keeps its long prose form — these are the GRID's formats. */
