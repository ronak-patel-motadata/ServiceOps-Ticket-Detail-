/* ── My Team listing ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   The shared register chrome (AssetRegisterPage) over the service desk's own roster:
   moduleCols="team" shows Name · Email · Contact No. · Action, with the module's filter
   catalogue, quick filters and saved views behind them. Everything else a supervisor
   might want on screen — role, group, shift, reporting manager, workload, last login —
   is one Manage-columns click away rather than crowding the default four.

   No navigation rail and no Kanban: people are found by WHO they are (group, role,
   availability), which the quick filters and the views rail already cover, and a roster
   has no work-in-flight axis to lane a board by.

   A row has no detail page of its own, so clicking one opens the product's existing
   profile popup with this person's real roster record rather than a derived stand-in. */
