/* ── Approval detail page ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Clicking an approval's id in My Approvals opens the record HERE, not in the
   module's own drawer. An approval can point at any kind of record — request,
   problem, change, release, hardware or software asset, contract, purchase —
   so this file is the ONE place the approver's detail experience is composed,
   and anything we change for approvals can never leak into the Requests /
   Change / Release / Asset pages that share those drawers.

   Today it is a faithful pass-through: it resolves the real record behind the
   approval and hands it to that module's detail page, so an approver sees the
   full record exactly as its own module renders it. Approval-specific chrome
   (banners, extra tabs, a decision footer, a trimmed-down layout…) lands in
   this file as it gets specified — at that point a module whose BODY has to
   change gets its own clone beside this file, and only the `case` below moves.  */
